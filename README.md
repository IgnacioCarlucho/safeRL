## HCOPE

High-Confidence Off-Policy Evaluation.
   

Python Implementation of HCOPE lower bound evaluation as given in the paper:
Thomas, Philip S., Georgios Theocharous, and Mohammad Ghavamzadeh. "High-Confidence Off-Policy Evaluation." AAAI. 2015.


## Importance Sampling

Implementation of:    
* Simple Importance Sampling   
* Per-Decision Importance Sampling    
* Normalized Per-Decision Importance Sampling (NPDIS) Estimator    
* Weighted Importance Sampling (WIS) Estimator   
* Weighted Per-Decision Importance Sampling (WPDIS) Estimator    
* Consistent Weighted Per-Decision Importance Sampling (CWPDIS) Estimator
